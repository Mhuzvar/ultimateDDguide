# Dormitory

## Dorm 2 - male dormitory

It is prohibited to use any cooking equipment or personal fridges in dorm 2 because apparently the circuitry wouldn't handle the load.

### Rooms in 14th floor

We have experience with the 4 bed rooms on 14th floor.

It has a private bathroom.

#### Bed

There are bunk beds with a desk and wardrobe under.

Do not buy mattress in the shop under dorm 3. It survives for like 2 weeks. Bring an inflatable matt \(The area of the bunk bed is approx. 1m by 2m\) or buy mattress in larger shops instead.

### 10th floor

In 2021 we couldn't get to Taiwan soon enough to get better rooms so we were put into 6 bed rooms on the 10th floor.

There are common facilities on the floor. All toilets except one were squat toilets.

There are hot and cold water dispensers but no fridge on the 10th floor. If you need to store anything in a fridge, you have to use common fridge on 11th (a minifridge) or 9th (regular sized fridge) floor.

## IKEA

There is an Ikea shop in New Taipei.

## Air conditioning

You need to buy a card to pay for the A/C at dorm 3 reception, it costs 600NTD. The $600 is a credit and you pay for electricity used by the AC.

You need to heat your room in winter as it easily gets down to 10Â°C.
