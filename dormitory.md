# Dormitory

## Dorm 2 - male dormitory

### Rooms in 14th floor

We have experience with the 4 bed rooms on 14th floor.

It has a private bathroom.

#### Bed

There are bunk beds with a desk and wardrobe under.

Do not buy mattress in the shop under dorm 3. It survives for like 2 weeks. Bring an inflatable matt \(The area of the bunk bed is large approx. 1m by 2m\) or buy mattress in larger shops instead.

#### IKEA

There is an Ikea shop in New Taipei

#### Air condition

You need to buy a card to pay for the A/C at dorm 3 reception, it costs 600NTD.

You need to heat your room in winter as it easily gets down to 10Â°C.
