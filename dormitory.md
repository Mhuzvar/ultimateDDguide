# Dormitory

## Dorm 2 - male dormitory

### Rooms in 14th floor

We have experience with the 4 bed rooms on 14th floor.

It has a private bathroom.

#### Bed

There are bunk beds with a desk and wardrobe under.

Do not buy mattress at the shop under dorm 3. It survives only for 2weeks. Instead bring an inflatable matt \(The area of the bunk bed is large approx. 1m by 2m\) or buy mattress in larger shops.

#### IKEA

There is Ikea shop in New Taipei

#### Air condition

You need to buy a card to pay for the aircondition at dorm 3 reception, it costs 600TWD.

In winter you need to heat your room, as it gets easily to 10Â°C
