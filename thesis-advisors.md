## Poki Chen

He describes himself as the funniest guy in the room.

As of 2018 there were 2 CTU students at his lab.

He is easygoing guy and most memorable quotations are:

> Just do your best.
>
> Maybe you can have something instead of nothing.
>
> Just do it.

Carefully pick your topic and be prepared to get absolutely zero support and help. You need to solve everything by yourself. You might be lucky and some students in the lab can help you but that's just luck.

Bear in mind that Poki asks you to tape-out a chip. Make this clear ASAP and do not repeat the same mistake as first students who were suprised by the required tape-out.

### LAB

You will get a wide desk with two screens and a quite powerfull machine \(I7-2600 + 16GB RAM in 2018\) You get one more comfortable chair and one less comfortable for your bag or whatever at your desk.

There's a large fridge with a freezer and a separate compartment for drinks.
