# Beers and drinking

## Beer

Beer is really expensive in Taiwan. Prepare to pay 220-270 NT$ for one.

### Where to go for a beer

Taiwan brewery in Taipei:  10491, Taiwan, Taipei City, Zhongshan District, No. 54 Weishui Rd

We liked JAP JAP BIKINI bar near Taipei Main Station. They have wide selection of craft beers from taiwanese breweries but the place is really expensive. Address: No. 72-26, Section 1, Zhongxiao W Rd, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, 100

## Whiskey

Whiskey is very cheap in Taiwan - low tax and high demand.
