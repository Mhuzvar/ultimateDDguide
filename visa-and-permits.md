# Visa and permits

## Paperwork in CZ

### Insurance

No insurance is provided by school. Unless you get a huge discount from someone the cheapest insurance is provided by ISIC.

### Proof of financial support

Ask at international office at FEE. It's across the hall from study office. They will verify you are considered international student by KOS and generate an official proof.

## Visas

### Visa-exempt

also called landing visa, for Czech passport holders you are allowed to stay 90days, then you need to do VISA run to another country.

To get in Taiwan on Visa-exempt you need to have proof of your outbound flight within 90days period before you board plane to Taiwan. In PRC you need to have printed booking, in western countries just flight number and date of your outbound flight is OK.

Get Record of ID number of Republic of China at the same place as ARC is issued. You need this for school, bank,... Use this number as your ARC number and ask the people who do not want to accept this number to RTFM - to read the immigration law!

### Study visa

To get visa for a stay over 180 days you need a resident visa for study purposes. To get them you need to apply online and bring required documents to Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Prague \(or elsewhere if that's closer for you\).

In fall of 2021 the office was ridiculously slow. Website says visa should take two days, someone claimed a week through email. Realistically they said "a few more days" every time someone called leading to almost two weeks processing time ended by erratic speedrun after quite literary tens of phonecalls.


## ARC

## Work permit

Difficult to get with VISA-exempt but I strongly believe it is possible to get if you go directly to the labour office as there is no mention about this in english translation of the immigration and labour law. It might be possible that other regulation issued by ministry of labour applies.

With ARC, just fill the form from your employer.

## Driving license

You need to have international driving license. Make sure to have the AM group listed there if you have group B. You will be able to get a scooter easier, not guaranteed.

Officialy IDL is only valid for 30days after arrival. You should get driving visa, but police actually do not care and car rental companies also do not care. Nobody ever checked my entry stamp in passport while checking IDL.
TIP. get a real credit card to rent a car \(FIO offers best free Credit Card, KB offers for 5CZK/month to students without asking for proof of income\). It can save you troubles with rental companies. They do not like debit written on the card.
