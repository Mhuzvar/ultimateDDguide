# Visa and permits

## Visa-exempt

also called landing visa, for Czech passport holders you are allowed to stay 90days, then you need to do VISA run to another country.

To get in Taiwan on Visa-exempt you need to have proof of your outbound flight within 90days period before you board plane to Taiwan. In PRC have printed booking, in western countries just flight number and date of your outbound flight is OK.

Get Record of ID number of Republic of China at the same place as ARC is issued. You need this for school, bank,... Use this number as your ARC number and ask the people who do not want to accept this number to RTFM - to read the immigration law!

## ARC

## Work permit

Difficult to get with VISA-exempt but I strongly believe it is possible to get if you go direcly to the labour office as there is no mension about this in english translation of the immigration and labour law. It might be possible that other regulation issued by ministry of labour apply.

With ARC, just fill the form from your employer.

## Driving license

You need to have international driving license. Make sure to have there group AM listed if you have group B. You will be able to get a scooter easier, not guaranteed.

Officialy IDL is valid only 30days after arrival. You should get driving visa, but police actually do not care and car rental companies also do not care. Nobody ever checked my entry stamp in passport while checking IDL. TIP. get a real credit card to rent a car\(FIO offers best free Credit Card, KB offers for 5CZK/month to students without asking for proof of income\). It can save you troubles with rental companies. They do not like debit written on the card.
