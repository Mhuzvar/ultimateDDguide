# What to buy?

## Whiskey

Kavalan is very good, can be considered as investment whiskey

Best to buy in duty free shop at the airport

## Some PC parts

GPUs and SSDs are cheaper here.

Recomended to buy EVGA GPUs with international warranty

Best to buy at shops close to Digital plaza, estimated price is approximately as at Alza.cz without VAT \(bez DPH\)

You can try to bargain.

## Bikes

Taiwan has cheap bikes, espetially folding bikes, because all is made here.

Go buy bikes at winter, when they sell last ear models for crazy discounts. 

In march I went to buy Tern folding bike and the price was 50% lower than official on website.

Make sure book plane ticket with company, that does not charge extra money for sports gear \(bike\)

## Scooter

It is possible to buy old scooter for example on the Facebook Taipei Buy and Sell page for approx 10000-20000 TWD, depending on age and status of a scooter.

Owning a scooter is pretty easy if you have ARC. You need to transfer an insurance and then scooter. Get a International Driving License \(Geneva 1949\) and apply for a driving visa on the Motor Vehicles Office. where you transfer the scooter.

Be careful with speeding around radars, or you get fined for 1200 NTD.  
Police officers usually don't speak English so there is good chance to avoid punishment in case you are caught.   
Do not use cell phone while waiting on traffic lights.  
Don't forget that scooters are often not allowed to turn left, you most do "hook" instead - go straight to rectangle and then continue left on next green.  
Scooters and small bikes are not allowed to use highways, elevated roads and some lines with yellow marks inside \(usually most left and also dedicated center lines\).
