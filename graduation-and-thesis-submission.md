# Graduation & Thesis submission

## Thesis

Make sure your thesis has Chinese cover page according to regulation.

You don't need Chinese name and Chinese abstract, English is good enough.

## Oral defense

You need to ask your advisor for committee members and negotiate available date with all of the professors. The Committee members get paid so you will probably need to coordinate with other students in the lab as well to save your advisor some money.

Once you have selected a date and time, fill in the form to apply for oral defense. Ask your lab mates or at the department office. The form needs to be signed by your advisor and submitted no later than **7 days** before defense. You need to get a stamp at the department and ask for room reservation. Submit the form to Ms. Huang on 4F.

You need to finish the thesis and send a copy to all committee members, due dates depends on your advisor.

Before the defense, register your thesis in the student online system and print out the required **3 forms** \(**Recommendation form, Qualification form** and **oral defense evaluation form** for every committee member/) before the defense.

The Oral defense is about 30 minutes of presentation and then 15-30 minutes of questions from the committee. Then be ready to explain all math background behind your thesis. After that you will pass because the only way you could fail is making your advisor unhappy with you.

Make sure to collect Recommendation form and Qualification form from the committee because you need it later for thesis submission.

## E-thesis submission

You should follow the instructions from email. You need to create a PDF of your thesis with official cover page and included **Recommendation form and Qualification form**. Double spacing and Times New Roman 11pt worked.

Fill in all the information in the online submission system and upload your PDF for revision.

You should wait for email with library approval. After that you can print and submitt hard copy of the thesis. It took me 3 hours to get approval, maximum is 3 days.

## Printing and hard copy submission of the Thesis

Get **2 approval forms signed** by you and your advisor, you got these from e-thesis system.

For library you need Thesis book in black hard cover \(master\), for department softer yellow cover is good enough. This will cost you a fortune - the hard cover is about 2000NTD below dorm 3. Off-campus printer shops at Gongguan are also expensive.

Somebody will check for finished courses, so make sure to get grades for Seminar and other courses before you start the quest.
